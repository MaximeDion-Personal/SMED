- **Seiso (Shine)**: Keep the workplace clean and free of dirt and debris. Regular cleaning helps maintain equipment and improve the overall working environment.
    
- **Seiketsu (Standardize)**: Establish standards and procedures for maintaining the first three Sâ€™s. This ensures consistency and helps in sustaining the improvements over time.
    
- **Shitsuke (Sustain)**: Foster a culture of discipline and continuous improvement. Regular audits and training help in maintaining the 5S practices.
